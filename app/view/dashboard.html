                            In a collaboration platform we need features to manage these elements.

                            One way to manage them is to organize and structure them.

                            People are organized in groups. Groups are structured into hierarchies. Documents are
                            structured
                            into topics, areas or containers. Communication is structured into topics, threads.

                            In this article we'll focus on documents and how to structure them.

                            The primary concept to structure documents in sTeam is a Room. Rooms can be nested, and they
                            can
                            have Doors or Gates to connect them. Doors can be one-way or bidirectional.
